# MMI 503 Audio Software Development Project 1: RMS Loudness and Spectral Analyzer

The problem addressed in this project is to develop a set of audio analysis functions that can provide insights into the loudness and spectral content of audio signals. The solution to this problem is a MATLAB code that generates the audio signals, analyzes them, and plots the results.

The analysis system consists of two main components: the audio signals generation and the audio analysis. The audio signals are generated using MATLAB code, which includes a white noise signal, a sine tone @ 1000 Hz, and an exponential sine sweep. The audio signals are then analyzed using two functions, the “rms_loudness” function, and the “spectral_analyzer” function. The loudness analysis function calculates and returns the root-mean-squared loudness in decibels, and the spectral analysis function calculates and returns the magnitude (in dB) and frequency bin values of the signals.
